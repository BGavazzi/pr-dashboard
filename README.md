# `pr_dashboard.py` — vertical PR dashboard

Narrow column (34 chars wide) showing open PRs, designed to **dock on the side of an ultrawide monitor** and run in watch mode. Each PR is a clickable card; in watch mode it's a **live interactive TUI** (filter and hide by keypress). Zero embedded credentials — uses the already-authenticated `gh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and logged in:
  ```bash
  gh auth status   # should show "Logged in"
  gh auth login    # if not yet
  ```
- Python 3.10+ (no external dependencies — stdlib only).
- Terminal with **OSC 8 hyperlink** support for clickable links
  (Windows Terminal, iTerm2, kitty, WezTerm, GNOME Terminal — all supported).

## Quick start

```bash
# single render of YOUR open PRs
python pr_dashboard.py

# watch mode — live TUI in the corner of your screen: refreshes every 60s + responds to keys
python pr_dashboard.py --watch
python pr_dashboard.py --watch 30      # refresh every 30s
```

On Windows there's a PowerShell wrapper that fixes UTF-8:

```powershell
.\pr-dash.ps1            # watch 60s
.\pr-dash.ps1 30         # watch 30s
.\pr-dash.ps1 -Once      # single render
```

## Keys (--watch mode, TTY)

The TUI responds to keypresses without restarting. Filters are live state:

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `space` | **reload now** from GitHub (reload button — doesn't wait for the interval) |
| `a` | show **all** PRs |
| `m` | only **ready to merge** (`mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`) |
| `c` | only **with conflicts** (`mergeStateStatus == DIRTY`) |
| `r` | **restore** all hidden PRs |
| `q` | **quit** |
| card letter/number | **hide** that PR (persistent — see below) |

The active filter is highlighted in the footer. Switching filters or hiding a PR re-renders **immediately** (no new API call); GitHub reload only happens when the `--watch` interval expires.

## Flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--watch [seconds]` | Loop with interactive TUI (default 60s). |
| `--no-rich` | Skips CI/review/merge/diff → **1 API call** only. Much faster. |
| `--ready` | Opens already filtered to "ready to merge" (= key `m`). |
| `--conflicts` | Opens already filtered to "with conflicts" (= key `c`). |
| `--org <ORG>` | Covers the entire org, not just PRs authored by you. |
| `--review-requested` | PRs awaiting **your** review (instead of yours). |
| `--no-builds` | Skip the **RUNNING BUILDS** panel (1 fewer `gh run list` call per repo). |
| `--builds-repo <O/R>` | Extra repo to watch for builds (**repeatable**). Overrides default. |
| `--clear-hidden` | Restore all hidden PRs and exit. |
| `--no-input` | Watch without keyboard (pure refresh) — for non-TTY environments. |

Examples:

```bash
python pr_dashboard.py --watch --ready                # open on ready-to-merge
python pr_dashboard.py --org <your-org> --watch       # whole org, interactive
python pr_dashboard.py --review-requested             # awaiting my review
python pr_dashboard.py --clear-hidden                 # reset hidden PRs
```

Via wrapper, pass flags with `-Args`:

```powershell
.\pr-dash.ps1 -Args '--org','<your-org>','--ready'
```

## Reading a card

```
 a  12d  ✗ changes ⚠     ← [label] · age · CI · review · merge state
 owner/my-repo #42         ← repo + number (Ctrl+click opens PR)
 feat(companies): notes    ← title with wrap (also clickable)
 history (append-only)…
 +856/-1                   ← diff (lines +/-)
────────────────────────
```

- **label** (`a`, `1`…): interactive mode only — press to hide the card.
- **Age**: green `<3d` · yellow `<14d` · red `≥14d`. Cards sorted **oldest first**.
- **CI**: `✓` all green · `✗` some failure · `⋯` running · `·` no checks.
- **Review**: `approved` / `changes` / `review` (pending) / `no review`.
- **Merge**: `⇪` (green) ready to merge · `⚠` (red) conflict · `↺` (yellow) branch behind base · *(nothing)* = `UNKNOWN`/`BLOCKED`.
- **`◌`** before the repo = PR is a **draft**.
- **`⏳ waiting <names>`**: appears when there's a requested reviewer who hasn't reviewed yet (up to 3 names + count). Sourced from `reviewRequests`.
- **`⟳ build running`**: appears when the PR's CI is in progress.

## RUNNING BUILDS panel

Above the cards, when there are **workflow runs in progress** on watched repos:

```
 RUNNING BUILDS · 1
 ⟳ owner/my-repo  production        ← glyph · repo · environment
   Deploy staging · main             ← workflow · branch/tag (Ctrl+click opens the run)
```

This is **intentionally separate from PR checks**: if CI runs on `push` (not on PRs), those runs don't appear as checks on any open PR. The panel fetches them via `gh run list`. `prod` (red) = workflow with "production" in the name; otherwise `homolog` (cyan).

**Watched repos** (precedence): `--builds-repo` (repeatable) → env `PR_DASH_BUILD_REPOS="owner/a,owner/b"` → default empty (panel disabled if no repo configured). Disable explicitly with `--no-builds`.

## Hidden PRs

Hiding a card (label key) removes it and saves to `~/.pr-dashboard-hidden.json` (key `owner/repo#num`) — stays hidden across runs. `r` restores all; `--clear-hidden` also works. The "(N hidden)" counter in the header counts only PRs you hid, not those filtered by `--ready`/`--conflicts`.

## Design notes

- **No credentials in code.** The token comes from the OS keyring via `gh auth`. Safe to version and share without leaking anything.
- **API cost.** Default mode makes `1 + N` calls (list + 1 `gh pr view` per PR for CI/review/merge/diff) **+ 1 `gh run list` per watched repo** for the builds panel. Switching filters or hiding cards does **not** call the API (local re-render). With many PRs, use `--no-rich`; to cut the panel, `--no-builds`.
- **Not real-time.** Watch sleeps the full interval between reloads — but `space` forces an immediate reload without waiting.

## Known limitations

- `gh search prs` doesn't expose `reviewDecision`/CI/merge directly → hence the `gh pr view` per PR. Without it (`--no-rich`) you lose those columns and the `--ready`/`--conflicts` filters.
- **`mergeStateStatus` is eventually consistent.** GitHub computes mergeability lazily: the first query on a PR may return `UNKNOWN` (no marker, excluded from `--ready`/`--conflicts`). The next watch refresh usually resolves it. A PR "disappearing" from `--ready` for one cycle is expected, not a bug.
- Column width is fixed at `W = 34` at the top of the script — adjust there if you want a different width.
